# My very first web page

## Welcome!

I'm Paolo, a new person jumped into this fabulous world of **coding**.
This is the repository for my first web site.
I created something simple, but I was very happy to understand what coding means and also what happens *behind* a webpage.
Started refreshing few things like:

1. writing contents in HTML 
2. playing again with CSS

Once finished, I've learnt what ***Git***, ***Githube*** and ***Cloud9 IDE*** are.
I've been struggling to understand what a repository is and all the git's codes.


[Thanks to CodeInstitue I'm learning all those thingsand  how to become a developer](https://www.codeinstitute.net)
